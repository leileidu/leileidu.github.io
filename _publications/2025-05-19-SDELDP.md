Estimating spatial distributions is important in data analysis, such as traffic flow forecasting and epidemic prevention. However, collecting data directly from individuals could compromise their privacy. Most previous works focused on private distribution estimation for one-dimensional data, which does not consider spatial data relation and leads to poor accuracy for spatial distribution estimation. In this paper, we address the problem of private spatial distribution estimation, where we collect spatial data from individuals and aim to minimize the distance between the estimated and actual data. To take advantage of the numerical nature of the domain, we propose a reporting mechanism called Disk Area Mechanism (DAM), which projects the spatial domain onto a line and optimizes the estimation using the sliced Wasserstein distance. Through extensive experiments, we show the effectiveness of our DAM approach on both real and synthetic data sets, compared with the state-of-the-art methods, such as Multi-dimensional Square Wave Mechanism (MDSW) and Subset Exponential Mechanism with Geo-I (SEM-Geo-I). Our results show that our DAM always performs better than MDSW and is better than SEM-Geo-I when the data granularity is fine enough.
